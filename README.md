Access
------

This is the main repository for the SDP team.  Before all team members receive 
pull & push access we need to go through how to use github correctly and 
effectively.

### Basic commands

To set up a local git repository:

	git clone git@github.com:DavidAndTheArgonauts/Talos.git

Get status of repository and staged files:

	git status

Add file to staging area (to be commited):

	git add file-name

Commit files (with a commit message):

	git commit -m "message"

List all branches:

	git branch -a

Change branch:

	git checkout branch-name

Pulling:

	git pull
	
Pushing:

	git push

Merging (merges branch-name into current code):

	git merge branch-name

List all commits:

	git log

### Getting access

To get full access please speak to me (Will) in the labs or give me an email at
w.pond@sms.ed.ac.uk.

Branches
